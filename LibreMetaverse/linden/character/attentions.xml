<!--
Default values for "Look At" controls.
Various events compete for avatar attention. I.E. control where the
user's avatar looks.
The avatar's head will turn to look towards the source of those events
as much as is possible. 
If the head cannot turn due to an animation override, the eyes will still
track those events.
Avatar attention will be taken by events of equal of greater priorities
and will last for timeout number of seconds before reverting to idle.
Negative timeout values indicate attentions that never time out.
Avatar sex determines which set of attention settings are used.
Within each set, the following named attentions relate to the indicated events:

IDLE: Tracks the mouse pointer movement.
AUTO LISTEN: Tracks nearby chat.
FREELOOK: Tracks "target objects" and a case of mouse moved in 3rd person mode.
RESPOND: Tracks the beginning of typing.
HOVER: Tracks objects the mouse lingers over when "show hover tooltips" is on.
CONVERSATION: Tracks avatars and other objects clicked on.
SEOECT: Tracks objects grabbed and being moved.
FOCUS: Freezes during avatar customization and when focused on object or point.
MOUSELOOK: Tracks center of view when in mouselook view mode.
