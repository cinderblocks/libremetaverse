LibreMetaverse
===============================================================================
LibreMetaverse is a fork of libOpenMetaverse which in turn was a fork of
libSecondLife, a library for developing Second Life-compatible virtual world
clients. LibreMetavrse returns the focus to up-to-date Second Life and OpenSim
compatibility with an eye to performance and memory management.

The canonical source for LibreMetaverse (as well as the bug tracker) can be
