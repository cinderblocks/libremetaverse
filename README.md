# LibreMetaverse

LibreMetaverse is a fork of libOpenMetaverse which in turn was a fork of
libSecondLife, a library for developing Second Life-compatible virtual world
clients. LibreMetaverse returns the focus to up-to-date Second Life and OpenSim
compatibility with an eye to performance, multi-threading, and memory management.

The canonical source for LibreMetaverse can be found at:

## Simple installation procedure

### Windows

The `dotnet` utility is cross-platform so compilation is no different than on Linux/macOS. 
You may, however, opt to use Visual Studio as you would any other .NET application.

### Linux/macOS

-  Make sure you have at least `dotnet` installed, with a valid SDK _and_ runtime of at least .NET6 available!

-  From the root, run `dotnet restore LibreMetaverse.Release.sln`. You should get some errors regarding missing Windows libraries; 
that's ok, you can ignore those, they're to be expected since Linux/macOS do _not_ include such libraries. Some test applications are Windows-only.  
If all goes well, you should now have all dependent packages properly installed.

-  From the root, run `dotnet msbuild LibreMetaverse.Release.sln`, and enjoy the superfast Roslyn compiler at work ðŸ˜„ 
It should finish after a few minutes, depending on the speed of your machine.

-  Your binaries will be under `../bin/net6.0` or `../bin/net7.0` (there might be a few more directories under `../bin`),
depending on what runtimes you have installed on your system. Make sure you `cd` to the correct directory depending on the runtime you have, 
and then search for all your binaries there: they should be normal-looking executable files (with the `x` attribute set) and having the name 
of the appropriate test application (e.g. `TestClient` for the interactive testing tool).

-  Unlike OpenSimulator and LibOpenMetaverse, you don't need to launch the binaries with Mono, they're _directly_ executable; 
the `dotnet` chain already embeds the small runtime that allows .NET apps to run natively on whatever operating system you've got.

### GUI support under Linux/macOS

LibreMetaverse.GUI is not available on Linux/macOS due to Microsoft's lack of support for GDI/WinForms on non-Windows platforms. 
They may work using Mono's implemention and can always be emulated using a product like Wine.

The GUI library is being phased out and eventually being replaced by a more cross-platform framework like Avalonia or MAUI.
